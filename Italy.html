            <h3>Pietrapertosa, Basilicata</h3>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>Pietrapertosa, Basilicata Pietrapertosa is the pearl of the southern region of Basilicata,
                which is located in the province of Potenza. The ancient name can be translated as “cut rock.” Here you
                will
                find the “real” Italy, not oversaturated with crowds of tourists. And if you want adrenaline, try what
                “Flight of an Angel” is. Not everyone dares to overcome 1415 meters above the rocks at an altitude of up
                to
                1000 meters at a speed of 110 km/h, even with the help of a cable, fastenings and a helmet...

            <h3>
                Castelsardo, Sardinia</h3>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>The island of Sardinia is home to many interesting places in Italy. Do you like beauty with a
                breeze? To you in Castelsardo! The commune is located in the northern part of the island of Sardinia.
                There
                are not only magnificent views of the Gulf of Asinara (and even Corsica!), but also quite strong winds.
                Also
                in Castelsardo there are charming little bays and a wonderful place for a summer holiday - the sandy
                beach
                “Lu Banyu”.</p>

            <h3>Gaiola, Campania</h3>
            <p>The region of Naples, which is located in the Italian province of Campania, hides one amazing area on its
                territory. This is the island of Gaiola, or rather two small rocky islands. The islands are connected by
                a
                bridge that looks literally airy, although it is made of stone. Gaiola is surrounded not only by the
                waters
                of the Gulf of Naples, but also by mysterious legends with a touch of mysticism... When visiting
                interesting
                and unusual places in Italy, Gaiola is definitely worth paying special attention to.</p>

            <h3>Blue Grotto, Campania</h3>
            <p>The Blue (or Azure) Grotto on the island of Capri is another beautiful attraction in Naples.
                The island itself is a decoration of the Tyrrhenian Sea in the Mediterranean. The Blue Grotto is 56
                meters
                long and has a fairly low entrance. To see this wonderful place, you will need a boat and calm weather:
                during a storm the grotto is not accessible to travelers.

            <h3>Burano, Venice</h3>
            <p>This is one of the most remarkable island Venetian quarters. The center of Venice is only 7 km
                from here. The area is famous not only for its vibrant architecture, but also for its airy lace, which
                is
                produced right here.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Sant'Agata de' Goti, Campania</h3>
            <p>The town of Sant'Agata de Goti in the province of Benevento is an ancient charming town,
                historical sites and vibrant festivals. It is especially beautiful here in the summer, on the holiday of
                Corpus Domini (Body and Blood of Christ, the 11th day after Pentecost according to the Gregorian
                calendar).
                Then the flower festival takes place in Sant'Agata de' Goti.</p>

            <h3>Aosta Valley, Valle d'Aosta</h3>
            <p>The Alpine Valley of Aosta is the resort highlight of the autonomous region of Valle d'Aosta.
                Mountain beauty, the purity and grandeur of the Alps, the proximity of famous ski resorts - the Aosta
                Valley
                combines all this. There is also grandiose architecture, such as the majestic medieval Verres Castle.
